Hello! My name is Shirlen (she/her). I'm a developer-in-the-making currently attending Flatiron School's Software Engineering track 
which emphasizes full-stack development utilizing Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React/Redux. When I'm not coding, I'm
usually adjusting to higher elevations by hiking, competitive gaming, making Blender3D models, or doing photography on the side.

_Fun fact:_ I was interrogated in a separate room when travelling due to TSA suspecting my laptop was a terrorist weapon.

## Learning:

* DS&A with Ruby & Java
* [Java programming](https://www.github.com/Ro5hi/studying_java)
* Computer Science fundamentals (Harvard & MIT resources)
* AWS

## Working on:

* My portfolio website
* Module 5 React/Redux project
* Other personal projects

## Goals:

* I'm aiming to make at least more than 5 commits a day to get myself coding on the daily.
* Hoping to meet other fellow developers!
