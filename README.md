Hello! My name is Shirlen (she/her). I'm a full stack developer currently attending Flatiron School's Software Engineering track 
which utilizes Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React/Redux. When I'm not coding, I'm usually exploring the outdoors, 
competitive/casual gaming, making Blender3D models, or doing photography work on the side.

_Fun fact:_ I was interrogated in a separate room when travelling due to TSA suspecting my laptop to be a terrorist weapon.

* Back-end: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Java, Sinatra
* Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, React.js (w/ Redux)
* Database: SQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL
* OS: Windows 10, Linux

## Learning:

* DS&A with Ruby & Java
* [Java programming](https://www.github.com/Ro5hi/studying_java)
* Computer Science fundamentals (Harvard & MIT resources)
* AWS

## Working on:

* My portfolio website
* Commissioned Restaurant SPA
* Module 5 React/Redux project

## Goals:

* I'm aiming to make at least more than 5 commits a day to get myself coding on the daily.
